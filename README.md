# MOVIE RECOMENDATION SYSTEM

A movie recommendation system is a type of information filtering system that seeks to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to a particular movie. It does this by collecting information about the user's past ratings of movies, as well as information about the movies themselves. This information is then used to calculate a similarity score between the user and the movie, and the movies with the highest similarity scores are then recommended to the user.
